## Description:
This project is a maritime horizon detection application. It detects the sea horizon and uses it as a reference for video stabilization. The horizon detector used for stabilization is described in the paper titled A Fast Horizon Detector and a New Annotated Dataset for Maritime Video Processing, published in the Journal of Image and Graphics (United Kingdom).
## How to use:
It's very simple: First, install the requirements. Then, open the .run.py file. Specify the video filename (if placed in the project directory) or the full path otherwise. After running the script, you will see the current progress in the console, and the stabilized video will be saved as an .avi file in the project directory with the prefix "stab_".
